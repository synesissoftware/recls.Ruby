  # Performs a recursive search and enumerates the lines of all files
  # found
  #
  # === Signature
  #
  # * *Parameters:*
  #   - +searchable+ A searchable instance obtained from +Recls::file_search()+ or +Recls::file_rsearch()+;
  #   - +search_root+ (+String+, +Recls::Entry+) The root directory of the search. May be +nil+, in which case the current directory is assumed;
  #   - +patterns+ (+String+, +Array+) The pattern(s) for which to search. May be +nil+, in which case +Recls::WILDCARDS_ALL+ is assumed;
  #   - +options+ (+Hash+) An options hash;
  #   - +flags+ (+Integer+) Combination of flags (with behaviour as described below for the +flags+ option);
  #
  # * *Block:*
  # An optional block that will be executed once for each line in each file
  # found, where the block must take 1, 2, or 3 parameters, representing the
  # line [ + file-line-index [ + entry ]]. If no block is given, an
  # enumerator is returned.
  #
  # ==== Parameter Ordering
  #
  # The parameters may be expressed in any of the following permutations:
  # - +searchable+
  # - +search_root+, +patterns+, +flags+
  # - +search_root+, +patterns+, +options+
  #
  # === Return
  # +nil+ if a block is given; otherwise, an instance of the +FileSearchLineEnumerator+.
