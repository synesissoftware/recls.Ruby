module Recls

  # Combines paths, optionally canonicalising them
  #
  # === Signature
  #
  # * *Parameters:*
  #   - +paths+ (+[ String, Recls::Entry ]+) Array of 1 or more path elements to be combined;
  #   - +options+ (+Hash+) Options that moderate the combination;
  #
  # * *Options:*
  #   - +:canonicalise+ (boolean) Causes the evaluated path to be canonicalised - with +Recls.canonicalise_path+ - before it is returned;
  #   - +:clean+ (boolean) Causes the evaluated path to be cleaned (i.e. sent to +cleanpath+) before it is returned. Ignored if +:canonicalise+ is specified;
  #   - +:clean_path+ (boolean) Equivalent to +:clean+, but deprecated and may be removed in a future version;
  #
  # === Return
  # (+String+) The combined path.
