  # Initialises a +FileSearch+ instance, which acts recursively, as an
  # +Enumerable+ of +Recls::Entry+
  #
  # === Signature
  #
  # * *Parameters:*
  #   - +search_root+ (+String+, +Recls::Entry+) The root directory of the search. May be +nil+, in which case the current directory is assumed;
  #   - +patterns+ (+String+, +Array+) The pattern(s) for which to search. May be +nil+, in which case +Recls::WILDCARDS_ALL+ is assumed;
  #   - +options+ (+Hash+, +Integer+) Combination of flags (with behaviour as described below for the +flags+ option), or an options hash;
  #
  # * *Options:*
  #   - +flags+ (+Integer+) Combination of flags - +Recls::FILES+, +Recls::DIRECTORIES+, etc. If the value modulo +Recls::TYPEMASK+ is 0, then +Recls::FILES+ is assumed. The value +Recls::RECURSIVE+ is added by the function, and so need not be added by the caller; it cannot be removed
  #
  # === Return
  # An instance of a class implementing +Enumerable+ whose value type is
  # +Recls::Entry+.
